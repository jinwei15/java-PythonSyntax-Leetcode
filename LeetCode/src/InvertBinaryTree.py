# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None


# Invert a binary tree.

# Example:

# Input:

#      4
#    /   \
#   2     7
#  / \   / \
# 1   3 6   9
# Output:

#      4
#    /   \
#   7     2
#  / \   / \
# 9   6 3   1
# Trivia:
# This problem was inspired by this original tweet by Max Howell:

# Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you canâ€™t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so f*** off.


# invert using BFS queue
