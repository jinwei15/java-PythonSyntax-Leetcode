# Given a list of words and two words word1 and word2, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.

# Example:
# Assume that words = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"].

# Input: word1 = “coding”, word2 = “practice”
# Output: 3
# Input: word1 = "makes", word2 = "coding"
# Output: 1
